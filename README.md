#Physics final project, the sports app demo

The attached files contain the acceleration and GPS coordinates detected during the walk.

Acceleration
GPS

The task is to write a Jupyter Notebook in Python where the following things are calculated and visualized either as a diagram or as numbers.



#Show the following things. 

A map of movement (Folium)
Distance graph (increasing from zero)
Velocity graph (calculated from coordinates)
Acceleration graph (observed [three components] and calculated from speed [one component]).
Note that these will be very different from each other!
Average speed as a number
Traveled distance as a number
The number of steps 
Note that calculating the velocity or distance from phone acceleration sensor data is not possible (although it sounds possible in terms of fundamental physics)! The reason is that the coordinate system is not fixed and the acceleration data is very noisy. 

#Answer the following questions:

Does the acceleration calculated from the speed match the observed acceleration? What differences do you notice? What could be their cause?
Is the number of steps logical?


Write a Jupyter Notebook logically, first do the calculations and then present the results. Write your thoughts in markdown.

Do one thing in one cell and tell about the cell's contents in the comment line at the beginning of the cell, e.g. "In this cell, the number of steps is calculated".

Write the numeric printouts of the values ​​clearly with the print command, e.g. "The number of steps is 27 " etc.

Return an executed Jupyter Notebook with the images and printouts visible.
